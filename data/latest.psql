Deals 564 damage to target and Gives Skill defense +20% to self and Taunt (90% provocation) for 12s.	Deals 1456 damage to 2 random enemies and drive Skill defense +30% for 15s to 5 allies.

Deals 1466 damage to 3 random enemies and drive Skill defense +20% for 15s to all allies.	The best tank in WorldBoss as she covers all allies with a barrier, regardless of element. Pretty hard to kill as well due to her self regen.
128	127	Attack +10% to Water Allies (Additional +8% attack to all allies (not limited to water) on Worldboss)	Deals 113 damage.	Deals 530 damage to target. On Debuffer types, deal 350 bonus damage	Prioritizing Debuffer Type, deals 400 damage + Tap Damage 3times to 1 enemy. On "Poisoned" targets, deal 500 Ignore Defense damage.

Really bad tank with skills all over the place. Slide is a worse version of Hades. Drive is a complete joke to use on any WB. Cute but that's not gonna save her from being a meme.
95	95	Heal and Regeneration (Heal every 2seconds) amount +5% to Dark units	Deals 96 damage.	Deals 335 damage to target and heals 201HP to ally with lowest HP.

Gives Berserk (Increase attack by +70% and becomes immune to damage, afterwards unit will be stunned for 5s) for 14s to 2 allies with lowest HP.	Goth Loli. Similar to Rusalka, but Metis' Berserk buff on drive is very useful in UndergroundEx and even raids - The downside is that her drive is hard to get the attacker buffed because she only buffs the lowest HP units, and then stuns for 5 seconds. With RNG on your side she can be quite good. With Botan's more reliable berserk drive, Metis usefulness has been reduced.
96	96	Weakness Skill Final Damage -8% to Light Types enemies	Deal 96 auto attack damage	Deals 335 damage to target and Heal effectiveness -40% ("Instant Heal" and "Regeneration") to 2 random enemies for 12 seconds	Deal 511 damage, Give "Regeneration" (Heal 171 HP per 2 seconds) to 2 lowest HP allies and Apply "Poetic Justice" (On 2 "buffed" allies, Instant Heal (total buffs+1)x150 HP; On 2 "debuffed" enemies, deal (total debuffs+1)x200 damage [total max buff/debuff counted per target is 4]) for 14 seconds	Deal 1537 damage to 2 random enemies and Apply "Poetic Justice" (On 3 allies with lowest HP, "Instant Heal" (total buffs+1)x350 HP; On 3 enemies with lowest HP, deal (total buffs+1)x400 damage [total max buff/debuff counted per target is 4])	Poetic Justice is pretty similar to how Bari's Stigma functions. So 2 allies with 4+ buffs get healed 750HP and 2 enemies with 4+debuffs get hit by max 1000 damage on his slide.
97	97	Recovery amount (Heal and Regen) +5% to Wood type allies	Deals 96 damage.	Deals 335 damage to target and gives Fortitude (removed after 10 seconds or upon taking 2 hits) to 1 ally with highest attack.	Gives 141HP Regeneration (Heal every 2seconds) for 14s and Fortitude (removed after 20 seconds or upon taking 4 hits) to 2 allies with lowest HP.	Gives 199HP Regeneration (Heal every 2seconds) for 16s and Fortitude (removed after 15 seconds or upon taking 3 hits) to 3 allies with lowest HP.	Syrinx doesn't have the strongest heals per tick, but her Fortitude bubbles is her greatest asset that it completely negates any damage no matter how high. In PVP her buff can help negate damage but when faced with DoTs, they destroys Fortitude stacks much faster. Best healer/tank combo.
98	98	Instant Heal rate +8% to Wood Allies	Deals 96 damage.	Deals 337 damage to target and Instant Heal for 214 HP and Apply "Secret Healing" (Heals 200 damages when attack and receives attacks) for 2 turns to 2 lowest HP allies.

Very unique healing buff. Healing version of the poison debuff. Drive makes 3 Allies literally un-killable for 16s. Most effective when played manually.
99	99	+8% defense for all allies (additional +12% on WorldBoss)	Deal 100 auto attack damage.	Deal 382 damage and a 70% chance to cancel 2 debuffs ('Burn' and 'Scalp').	Deal 660 damage and apply "Double-Edge Sword" (Increase attack by 50%, but decrease defense) to 5 water allies for 16 seconds. For WorldBoss Only, Slide Skill Damage +1250 for 16 seconds to 5 allies in the back row with the highest attack.	Deal 1733 damage to 2 enemies randomly and allies drive gauge +400.

Deals 1765 damage to 3 enemies, Max HP +1500 and agility +2000 for 20s to 3 allies with highest attack.	Limited collab child from Kemono Friends 2 Collab
102	1	Heal and Regeneration (Heal every 2seconds) amount +5% to Light units	Deals 95 damage.	Deals 330 damage to target, and removes freeze and petrification from 1 ally.	Gives 146HP Regeneration (Heal every 2seconds) for 20s to all allies.	Revives 1 dead ally to 1000HP and gives 300HP Regeneration (Heal every 2seconds) for 16s to 3 allies with lowest HP.	Only child that can heal the whole team in WB. Maat + Leda combos are really strong, especially with Leda's leader skill. Maat is very useful in PVE and can be a real annoyance for the enemy in PVP. Her auto taps too much unfortunately.
103	102	Defense +8% to Wood type allies	Deals 99 damage	Deals 363 damages to target and Gives +20% Defense and +15% Debuff Evasion to 2 lowest HP allies for 10secs.

104	103	Light allies heal and regeneration amount +15%. 	Deals  96 damage. 	Deals 337 damage to target, gives +15% debuff evasion to 2 allies with the lowest HP. 	Prioritizing 2 allies with the lowest HP, Regen 191 HP (once per 2 seconds) and gain debuff immunity (cleanse all current debuffs and negate 1 incoming debuff after for 14 seconds). 	Revives 1 dead ally to 1000HP and Heal 1791HP to 3 allies with the lowest HP. 	Her ability to cleanse all manner of debuffs can make event bosses with nasty debuff mechanics difficulty trivial. She also has a revive in her drive in case a child dies.
168	167	Attack +7% to Dark units	Deals 54 damage	Deals 145 damage to target and critical +300 for 8s to 1 random ally	Critical rate +25% for 18s and critical damage +15% for 14s to 2 allies with highest attack	Deals 720 damage to 1 random enemy and attack +800 for 16s to 2 allies with highest attack	
105	104	Increase HP recovery of all allies (instant or HoT) +10%.	Deal 96 auto attack damage.	Prioritizing allies with the lowest HP remaining, heal 314 to 2 allies.	For 8 seconds to 4 allies except herself, apply "Immortal" (HP cannot drop below 1 when being attacked). \r\nPrioritizing allies with least HP, HoT 231 (once every 2 seconds) to 2 allies for 12 seconds.

An improved Rusalka. Seems more geared towards pvp because of her immortality buff affecting most of the party.
106	105	Heal and Regeneration (Heal every 2seconds) amount +5% to Water units.	Deals 96 damage.	Heals 233HP to 2 allies with lowest HP.	Gives 1.8%HP+21HP Regeneration (Heal every 2seconds) for 12s and Immortality (HP won't go under 1) for 10s to 2 allies with lowest HP.	Heals 12%HP+90HP and gives Immortality (HP won't go under 1) for 14s to 3 allies with lowest HP.	Her immortality can be a lifesaver sometimes, but her overall healing is not very strong. Power creeped by Venus.
107	106	Drive Gauge Charge -5% to all enemies (Additional 8% on Worldboss).	Deals 101 damage	Deals 381 damage to target and Apply "Poison" (causes 200 damage each time target acts; triggers 30% of poison damage when they receives an attack) for 2 turns. Within 8s debuff effect on 2 enemies will have it's duration extended by 30% (from current remaining duration).	Deals 617 damage to 2 random enemies and 70% chance to remove 1 buff from the target (last applied buff).\r\nApply "Debuff Explosion" (removes first applied debuff and deals damage according to the debuff type x200 modifier).	Deals 1983 damages to 3 random enemies and Apply "Poison" (causes 800 damage each time target acts; triggers 30% of poison damage when they receives an attack) for 3 turns.	Similar to Nirrti, but more offensive than defensive in terms of skills.

Great in all content and can easily replace Kouga when skill cooldown isn't as important as speed buff and damage buff. Can be used with Kouga to get a really speedy team.
110	109	Critical rate +15% to Dark allies	Deals 99 damage.	Deals 364 damage to target and critical rate +35% for 7s to 1 random ally.

Kouga is the best support unit in the game and a must have. Her buffs can help attackers deal more damage or help your team survive by targeting a healer on the team - Healers have long cooldowns, so Kouga is great at decreasing it with her slide. Her tap is usually more RNG even at +6 uncap, and even at 83% she will not activate her tap passive skill if spammed. The tap skill will also only fully charge an ally's skill gauge if they are not on a counter cooldown, so use it wisely. On drive, +400 drive gauge is 13% of the drive gauge (excluding during WB).
