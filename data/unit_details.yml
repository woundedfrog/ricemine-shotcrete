  tap: Deals 335 damage to target and heals 201HP to ally with lowest HP.
  slide: Gives 1.5%HP+21HP Regeneration (Heal every 2seconds) for 10s and Immortality

  drive: Gives Berserk (Increase attack by +70% and becomes immune to damage, afterwards
    unit will be stunned for 5s) for 14s to 2 allies with lowest HP.
  notes: Goth Loli. Similar to Rusalka, but Metis' Berserk buff on drive is very useful
    in UndergroundEx and even raids - The downside is that her drive is hard to get
    the attacker buffed because she only buffs the lowest HP units, and then stuns
    for 5 seconds. With RNG on your side she can be quite good. With Botan's more
    reliable berserk drive, Metis usefulness has been reduced.

    In PVP her buff can help negate damage but when faced with DoTs, they destroys
    Fortitude stacks much faster. Best healer/tank combo.

  notes: Shares the highest poison dmg with Eve but lasts 4 turns vs Eve's 3 turns.
    Downside is his slide targets highest attack vs Eve's lowest health making him
    worse. Tap Skill is worse than Eve due to lower base damage for fever. Still a
    good alternative for Eve for poison dealing.
