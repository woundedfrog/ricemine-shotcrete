  notes: Only affecting fire childs make her restrictive in teambuilding. Slide is
    lackluster due to the restriction and being reliant on taking damage for a larger
    defense buff. Drive may be useful for Wood World Boss, but also requires your
    team to be low health for the greatest effect, which is unreliable. Anti-Barrier
    on tap doesn't provide enough value to justify using her in PvP.

  notes: Best choice for new players in Lisa's Lessons on Day 7 as a versatile attacker
    who will carry you through early and mid game. Currently has the highest poison
    damage in the game. Fallen out of favor in PvP due to Bathory halving her poison
    damage, and Nicole beating her in burst damage. Poison deals 100% damage whenever
    the target acts (autoattack, tap, slide, or drive), and deals 30% of poison damage
    when they receive an attack. As opposed to your own AI, the enemy AI won't prioritize
    non-poisoned childs when fevering, which can result in your enemy killing themselves
    through fever if they're poisoned.

  notes: She should be categorized as a damage buffer rather than a tank, as she doesn't

    Wood Ragna as well as all Wood World Boss. Her damage buff allows your fire DPS
    to keep up with the other elementally advantaged attackers in World Boss, which
    means you can recycle the Daoine squad instead of investing in additional attackers
    for that element. However, note that running Daoine Sidhe and fire attackers will
    steal buffs away from your other counter element attackers for World Boss, making
    weak point attacks less effective. With a high uncap Newbie Mona on your World

  notes: Good for Wood World Boss, especially when paired with a bleed child such

    but has little place in the current meta with Bathory around.

    unreliable in Ragna due to the high resist; in World Boss, this can be alleviated
    thanks to other childs' Debuff Evasion debuffs. In PvP, Confuse will temporarily
    turn the fight into a pseudo 6v4. Weaker version of Limos for PvP.

    prevent the frequency that boss uses their drive skills, increasing survivability
    for your frontline. Pairs well with Isolde thanks to their shared targeting.
